What is a software?
- Software which can reduce the human efforts.Will get quick solutions for the problems.

What are the different types of applications we have in realtime?
- Standalone apps
	- An Application which need to be install in every user machine in order to use.
	- One user at a time can be use that applications
	- Examples: Mobile Apps, Windows Apps, Console Apps etc.
- Distributed Apps
	- An application which is not require to install in every user machine inorder to use.
	- The application will be installed/hosted in "Server"(Machine) and we can access it with the help of client, server can be anything like Web Server/Application Server can be consumed by client and client is nothing but "Browser".
	- Example: Web Applications
- Service Based Apps
	- These are used to provide the services to the existing application.
	- Examples: Payment Gateway
- IOT(Internet Of Things):
	- An application which is having direct interaction with internet.
	- Example: AC, Washing Machines, Alexa etc.

Web Technologies:
- A technology is used to build a kind of application development.
- To build the web applications we use "Web Technologies".
- There are two types of web technologies are avaible like
	- Client Side Technology
	- Server Side Technology: A technology which can be used to interact with the server and perform the CRUD operations with the DB. Examples: ASP.Net, JSP, JDBC etc. 

Client Side Technology: 
- The techonologies which are understandable by the browser.
- By using this we are going to build two types of web pages like

Static Web Page
- The web page where it maintain same content for any user's request.
- Example: Login pages, Home pages etc.
- Technologies used to build static pages are like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc.

Dynemic Web Page
- For every user request if the content is created seperatly is called dynemic web page.
- Examples: Every website once we login we will get the different content.
- Technologies used to build dynemic web pages are Javascript, jQuery, Angular JS, Angular, React etc.

HTML: It is used to format the content on the browser, how the content will be displayed on browser, It contain mainly Tags, Attributes and Elements.

CSS: It is used to style the HTML elements, It contains mainly properties to apply the styles.

Javascript: It is used to convert the static web designs into dynemic, changes the state of web page by applying different events and functionalities etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
- A realtime web application is nothing but, the application where we can store the user's information permently.
- To store that information we use "Database", a database where it contains information permently in the form of tables => Collection of Rows + Columns

HTML:
- It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
- Hyper text is nothing but a text/content which is having "hyperlink".
- Markup language is nothing but the text which is surrounded with "<>".
- Browsers will only understands HTML.
- The latest version of HTML is "HTML5".
- Every HTML tag is approved by the company i.e. "W3C(World Wide Web Consortium)", it contains some standers for web application develoment.
- Html is not a case sensitive, but all the tags should be created with lower case letters only.

Verison History:
Version		Year
HTML 1		1990
HTML 2 		1995
HTML 3		1997
HTML 4 		1997 - 2014
HTML 5		2014 - latest

What we have in HTML?
HTML is the combination of three things mainly
	- Tags
	- Attributes
	- Elements
Tag:
- it is nothing but which can be surrounded with "<>".
- These tags are of two types 
	- Open tag (<h1>)
	- Closing tag (</h1>).

Attribute:
- It is used to provide the additional functionality/information for the HTML tags.
- Always attributes/properties will be applied for open tags only.
- Examples: align, style, border, value, type etc. 

Elements:
- An element is the combination of tags and attributes
- These are of two types
	- Normal Elements: Whcih is having complete Open tag + Attributes + Closing tags
		Example: <h1 align="center">Welcome</h1>
	- Void Elements: Which is having Open tag + Attributes.
		Example: <input type="text">
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where to write HTML programs?
- To write the HTML we have many options are avaible like
	- Code Editor
	- IDE(Integrated Development Environment)
- Code Editors are used to write the code and for execution of code we will follow different approch, examples are like Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime, Brackets, Editplus etc.
- IDE means where we will write the code and also we can execute it directly, examples are like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse etc.
Note: Mostly all client side application development will be with "Visual Studio Code".

What is structure of HTML5 web page?
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
    We will write meta information
 </head>
 <body>
    Here we will have actual content which is used to display to the user
 </body>
</html>

- <!DOCTYPE html> which tells the browser that which version of HTML document we are going to build.
- Every HTML document will start with <html> tag, and it is divided into two parts with two tags like <head> and <body>.
- <head> part of the html document will be used to define metadata information about the HTML pages.
	- Write the styles
	- Write the meta information like author, SEO, page refresh, redirections etc.
	- script logics also can be implmeneted.
- <body> this section is used to write the content for the users, so that user's will interact with the content on the browser.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Headding tags: Used to specify the headding for the content, we have total  6 tags are presented like h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.
- Paragraph: It is used to display a paragraph of text in the browser, to use this we use a tag i.e. <p>.

HTML Links:
- A link is used to provide the navigation for the HTML document.
- Navigation is nothing but redirecting/sending request from one web page to another or with in the application also.
- To implement the navigation we use <a>(Anchor tag).
- Example: <a href="url">Link text</a>, where href stands for HyperLink Reference.
- URl stands for "Unifrom Resource Locator".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visual Studio Code:
- It is an IDE(Intergrated Development Environment) tool.
- It is used mainly to build client side web application development, by writing the code using HTML, CSS and Javsacript.
- To build the client side applications we have different tools are available like
	- Notepad
	- Notepad++
	- Sublime
	- Atom
	- Visual Studio Code
	- Editplus
	- Bracket
	- Eclipse
	- Visual Studio Edition etc.
- But mostly according to the current industry we use "Visual Studio Code".
Advantages:
- Intellisence support
- Git hub which is a Verison Control tool/ Source code Mangement tool, whcih is used to manage the code for the application and provide the sharing in between them.
- Extension, these are used to add the additional features in order to build the web application in faster rate.
- Write less and do more.
- We can run the VS code in any Operating System.

How to install Visual Studio Code:
Step-1: Open the web site "https://code.visualstudio.com/"
Step-2: Create the HTML file
Step-3: Execute from browser.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lists in HTML:
- In HTML lists are used to display the collection of elemenents
- There are three types of lists in HTML5
	- Unordered List: <ul> - Unordered List and <li> - List Items.
	- Ordered List: <ol> - Ordered List and <li> - List Items
	- Definition List: It is used to display all the definitions, by using 
		<dl>	-	Definition List	
		<dt>	-	Defintion Term
		<dd>	-	Data Definition
Note:
- <hr> tag is used to provide a horizantal line 
- <li> - list item, <ol> - Ordered List, <ul> - Unordered List.
- To create defintion list we use following tags like 
	- <dl> - Definition List
	- <dt> - Definition Term
	- <dd> - Data Definition 
- "type" attribute is used to provide different list style formats.
- Any list can be created in any other list we call it as nested lists.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tables in HTML:
- It is used to display the data in the tabular format on the browser.
- These are used to display a collection of tabular information like
	- Cricket Scores
	- Time tables
	- Bank Account trasactions etc.
- To create the table we use following tags like

<table> - Used to represent the table
<tr> - Used to represent the table row.
<td> - Used to represent table data/column.
<th> - Used to provide the headdings for the columns.

- To work with the table we use following attributes like

* border: Used to set the border for the table and default values are 1(with Border) and 0(no Border)
* align: Used to align the table in center/right/left on the browser
* colspan: Used to merge multiple columnnot singlemn.
* rowspan: Used to merge multiple rows into single
Note: Above two properties/ attributes will be applied for <td> tag by default.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Tags in HTML5:
- Semantic elements have meaningful names which tells about type of the content.
- Examples: header,footer, table, aside,nav etc.
- In HTML5 we have many sematic tags are introduced like
Tags:
- article
- aside
- details
- figcaption
- figure
- footer
- header
- main
- mark
- nav
- section
- style etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Text formatting tags:
- These tags are used to format the text like bold, italic, underline,overline and line through etc. 
List of formating tags are:
Tags		Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<a>		-	Defines the Hyperlink
<abbr>		-	Defined an abbrivated form of a longer word
<acronym>	-	Deprecated(Outdated)
<address>	-	Gives the contact information
<applet>		- 	Deprecated(Outdated)
<area>		-	Used to define within the image map
<article>
<aside>
<audio>
<b> -> <strong>
<base>
<basefont> 	-	Outdated
<bdo>
<caption>
<center>		-	Outdated
<code>
<del>
<dailogue> etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attributes in HTML5:
- An attribute is used to define additional information for the HTML elements.
- There are different attributes are avaible based on the tags like
- There are two types of attributes in HTML
* Generic/Global: These attribute can be applied for any HTML tags.
id	: 	It is used to provide unique identification for html element
name	: 	It is used group related elements
class	:	It is used to apply the list of CSS styles for the element 
title	:	Used to provide title for the element
style	:	Used to provide inline styles	

* Sepecific: These can applied only for specific tags
Link	-	href, title
Img	-	src, width, height, alt
table	-	border, align
td	-	colspan, rowspan
html	-	lang
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input elements and Forms in HTML5:
- An input control is used to takes the input from the user and send it to the server.
- In HTML5 there are many input controls are avaible like text,password,color,number, range etc.
- syntax: <input type="type of control" id="" name=""/>
- All the input controls are by default void elements,means we don't have open and closing and content.
- Every input element is a inline element.
- "id" is an attribute which gives unique identification for HTML elements.
- The best practive to give the id is by using "Hungarion Notation".
	TextBox		-	txt
	RadioButton	-	rbtn
	Button		-	btn
	CheckBox		-	chk
	DropDownList	-	ddl etc.
- Every input element in HTML should be wrapped with the help of <form> tag.

Controls		Description
text		Used to create a TextBox
password		Used to create a TextBox which accepts password as input.
color		Used to create a control which will display color box
range		Used to create a spinner 
number		Used to create a slider which is having number range.
date		Used to create date control
email		Used to accept email data
tel		Used to accept telephone number etc.

Note: If any input control is not able to understable by the browser by default it will be converted into "TextBox".

Attributes in Input controls: id, name, class, min, minlength, required, max,maxlenght etc.
- Form tag is used to group the input controls.
- Form tag will be having following advatages
	- Send the data to the server by using "action" atribute.
	- method attribute is used to specify "get/post" means used to send the data or 		retrive the data from server.
	- We can perform validations as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTML <head> tag:
- It is used to maintain extra infromation about the html doument i.e. metadata.
- head section will contains following tags like
1) <title>	 : Used to provide the title for the page, title should be short and lessthen 65 charecters and if we give a proper title then when user search in search engine it will automatically highlighted.

2) <base> : This element is used to define a base url for all the relative urls's that are contained in the website. Once we can give base url every request is taking that url and process it.

3) <link> : This element is used to define the relationship between the current document nad other documents, mainly it is used to add the external css for the application.
 	<link rel="stylesheet" href=""/>

4) <style> :  Used to provide css internal styles to represent better user interface.

5) <meta> : 
- <meta> tag is used to provide structured metadata such as document's keywords, description, author, charcter set, redirection etc.
- <meta> data is not visible to the user, it is only for developers.

6) <script> : It is used to add internal/external script for the application. Used to write javascript code for making html tags as dynemic in nature.

7) <noscript>: It is used to define an alternative text to be dispayed when the user blocks the javascript code on the browser.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multimedia Elements in HTML5:
- These are mainly used to add and audio or video tags on the HTML web page.
- To add an audio/video file we use <audio> and <video> tag is required and it comes with following attributes like
	- controls: It is used to add the play, pause, loop such kind of controls to run the app.
	- loop: It is used to restart the audio/video again once if it is finished
	- autoplay: Used to play the audio/video when it loaded for the first time.
	- To add any audio/video file we use <source> tag

HTML5 new features:
* HTML5 New Input Elements: 
- color, date, datetime-local,email,month, number, range,search etc.

*Canvas and SVG:
- Canvas/SVG(Scallable Vector Graphics) can be used to draw the graphics, a graphic is nothing but the text is represented with an image. But if we want to use this we have to integrate Javascript.

*Web Storage: 
- The HTML 5's web storage us used to store some information locally on the user's computer.
- It is much better than coockie, in html5 we have two types
	- Local Storage: It is permement and store in the Harddisk.
	- Session Storage: It is maintain the data until we close the browser.
Note: This feature of HTML5 also need to run with the help of Javascript.

*Drag and Drop feature:
- It allows to drag and drop an element into another elements.
Note: This feature of HTML5 also need to run with the help of Javascript.

* Mulitmedia Elements:
- These are used to add the Audio/Video on the HTML web page.
- To implement that we have <audio> and <video> tags.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS(Cascading Style Sheets):
- CSS is the language we use to style the HTML elements.
- HTML is just used to define the data, By default all the HTML elements are not provide any default styles like alignment,background colors, fore ground colors etc.
- Inorder to provide the styles for the HTML elements we use "CSS".
- CSS will contains list of properties those are used to assign the values for the HTML elements. 
- To write the CSS we have 3 approches are avaible like
	- Inline CSS(Not used in realtime)
	- Internal CSS
	- External CSS

Inline CSS:
- If the CSS styles are specified in the html open tag by using "style" attribute we call it as Inline styles.
- Example: <h1 style="background-color: yellowgreen;">Example with Inline CSS</h1>
- In realtime we never use inline style to style the HTML elements.

Internal CSS: 
- In this we will write the CSS styles in the HTML document by <style> tag under the <head> section of the document.
- These styles are only for that html document and if we want to apply same styles in another html documents then it is not helpful.

External CSS:
- In this css style are created in a seperate file and save the file with an extension "*.css".
- Once we define styles by using external css we can use across any web page by using <link> tag.
- Mainly these styles are used in the application development.
- Example: <link rel="stylesheet" href="./mystyles.css">
- In that "rel" attribute is used to defines the relationship with the file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments in HTML and CSS:
- In HTML to write the comments we use <!-- comment  -->
- In CSS to write the comments we use /* comment */
- Comments gives us a clear idea about what we are doing in the application.
- These comments are only used for developers to understand the code.
- Comments are completly ignored by the browser

Selectors in CSS:
- Selectors are used to select the HTML elements from the document.
- There are different selectors are available to select the HTML elements.
- These selectors are like
	- ID Selector
	- Class Selector
	- Tag name selector etc.
* Tagname selector: It is used to find the HTML tags by using the tag name and then will write the properties.
	Syntax: h1{color:red;}

* class selector: It is used to specify the style by using any name and later can be apply with any other html tags. To implment this before the class name we use dot(.)
	Syntax: .C1{color:red}

*ID selector: This selector is used to find the specific single element from the HTML document and then we will apply the styles.To write the ID selector we use "#".
- According to good programming practice we should have unique ID for every HTML element.
	Syntax: #p1{color:red;}

Note: 
- Among ID, Class and tagname selectors "ID selector" is having "High Priority".
- Among Class and tagname selector "Class Selector" is having more priority.
- Tag name selector is having less priority among all.

* In General in CSS we use class selector mostly to style the HTML elements.
* In General in Javascirpt we use id selector mostly to find the element from the DOM.
